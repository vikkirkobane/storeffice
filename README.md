# Storeffice

**Office Space Booking & Product Marketplace Platform**

Storeffice is a dual-purpose marketplace that enables users to book office spaces and rent shelf/storage spaces for product inventory. It combines the booking model of Airbnb with the marketplace model of Alibaba/Amazon, creating a unified ecosystem where office owners monetize spaces, merchants advertise and store products, and customers discover goods.

---

## 📊 Executive Summary (Investors)

### Problem
- Underutilized office and storage spaces represent lost revenue for property owners.
- Small merchants struggle to find affordable, flexible storage with built-in visibility.
- Customers lack a single platform to discover both workspaces and products.

### Solution
Storeffice connects three user types on one platform:
- **Owners** list office/storage spaces with dynamic pricing and calendar management.
- **Merchants** rent storage, list products, and reach local customers.
- **Customers** book offices and shop products with integrated payments.

### Market Opportunity
- Global coworking market: \$13B+ (2025) → \$37B (2030)
- Self-storage market: \$120B+ (US alone)
- East Africa commercial real estate digitization accelerating

### Business Model
- Booking commissions (10–15%)
- Monthly storage rental fees
- Product listing fees and transaction charges
- Premium features (analytics, promotions)

### Traction & Roadmap
- **Q2 2026**: MVP launch (web) with core booking + marketplace
- **Q3 2026**: Mobile app (React Native)
- **Q4 2026**: Stripe payments, email/SMS notifications, real-time chat
- **2027**: Expansion to 5 metropolitan areas in Africa & US

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (local or Supabase)
- Git

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikkirkobane/storeffice.git
cd storeffice
npm ci
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set:

- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection (see below for options)
- `AUTH_SECRET` — a random 64+ char string (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` — e.g., `http://localhost:3000`
- Optional: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, etc.

#### Database options

**Local with Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:storeffice123@localhost:5432/storeffice
```

**Supabase Cloud (free tier):**
1. Create a project at https://supabase.com
2. In Settings → Database, get the connection string
3. Set `DATABASE_URL` to that value

### 3. Apply Database Schema
```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will create all tables defined in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`.

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5. Access the App
- Home page: `/`
- Login: `/login`
- Register: `/register`
- Dashboard: `/dashboard` (protected)

---

## 🗄 Database Schema

The platform uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with 30+ tables. Key entities:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `profiles` | User accounts (extends auth) |
| `office_spaces` | Office space listings |
| `storage_spaces` | Storage/shelf space listings |
| `products` | Merchant product catalog |
| `bookings` | Office space reservations |
| `storage_rentals` | Storage rental contracts |
| `carts` | Shopping cart items |
| `orders` | Purchase orders |
| `payments` | Payment transactions |
| `reviews` | Ratings and reviews |
| `favorites` | Saved spaces/products |
| `messages` | User-to-user messaging |
| `notifications` | In-app notifications |

Full ER diagram: see `docs/Schema.md` (to be generated).

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Storeffice uses **better-auth** with a Drizzle adapter for PostgreSQL.

- **Credentials**: Email + password with bcrypt hashing
- **Social logins**: Google, Apple, Facebook (configurable)
- **Email verification**: Required (via SendGrid)
- **Password reset**: Built-in flow
- **Sessions**: HTTP-only cookies, 7-day expiration

User types (`profiles.user_type`):
- `customer` – browse and book
- `owner` – manage listed spaces
- `merchant` – storage + products
- `admin` – platform oversight

---

## 📡 API Reference

### Public Endpoints
| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check (DB status) |
| `GET` | `/api/spaces` | List active office spaces (public) |
| `GET` | `/api/products` | List active products (public) |

### Authenticated (via better-auth)
All `/dashboard/*` pages and API routes require a valid session.

Server actions (called from components) manage mutations securely.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e
```

## 📦 Project Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Next.js development server with Turbopack |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate Drizzle migrations from schema |

## 🚢 Deployment

### Recommended: Vercel
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set environment variables (Supabase, Stripe, etc.)
4. Deploy

### Additional: Supabase
- Set up a Supabase project and attach it in Vercel integrations
- Run `npm run db:push` on first deploy (via Vercel build hook or manually)

### PostgreSQL Migrations in Production
We use `drizzle-kit push` for schema sync. For production with complex migrations, consider:
- Generate SQL migrations: `npm run db:generate`
- Review `drizzle/*.sql` files
- Apply via `npm run db:migrate` (or manual psql)
